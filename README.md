Geared towards parents wanting to monitor their child.

Features added:
- An ability to track time and display it in a pie chart
- Block and unblock websites w/ password based on which ones the parent wants to block
- Block/unblock schedule rules (it's there, but not working)

To be added:
- Reminders about how much time is spent on a website (30-min warning, 1-hr warning, etc.)
- Customized reward system that gives a point for a determined unit of time that the kid spent on a preferred website. The kid can use the reward points to convert to an amount of time that they can spend on other play websites that the parent can also set (for example YouTube)

- Allow the parent to temporarily unblock a website with a password
